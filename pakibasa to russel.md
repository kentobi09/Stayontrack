*PROBLEMS
- No visuals or warnings when login credentials are invalid
- Why password can't take letters,numbers, and special characters at the same time. It gives an error.
- The adding part in the home page is not functionable. I'm unable to start the whole function of the website because of this, fix ASAP.
- settings?
- language?
- pie chart?
